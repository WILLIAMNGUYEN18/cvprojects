In addition to the (unreleased API), I was hoping to also get critical information from certain gameplay elements in the UI.
* Will need some pro players to source relevant time series data from

Once we can identify these elements, we will be able to attach them to a corresponding time, creating a time series data set.
Long term, I will hopefully be able to congregate match data to create relevant player analytics (ability timings, spike plants, nade positions, etc)

Previous similar work at Microsoft Research.
